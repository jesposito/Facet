**Purpose:** Make Facet easier to understand and use

### 17.1 Guided Setup Wizard (✅ Complete)
**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Medium

First-time users get a 3-step wizard instead of facing 22 admin pages:
- Step 1: Basic profile (name, headline, summary)

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Low

One-click sharing to major platforms with native OS integration.

**Implementation:**
- `frontend/src/lib/share.ts` - Share utility with Web Share API detection
- `frontend/src/components/shared/ShareButton.svelte` - Reusable component

**Features:**

- Email: `mailto:?subject={title}&body={text}%0A%0A{url}`

**Where it shows:**
- View pages (`/[slug]`) - Always visible
- Post pages (`/posts/[slug]`) - Only if `visibility === 'public'`

- ❌ Bluesky (niche, user preference)
- ❌ Instagram (no web share URL)

### 18.2 View Analytics Dashboard
**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Medium

**Implementation:**
- New page: `/admin/analytics`
- Dashboard showing:
  - Total views per view (bar chart)
  - Share token usage stats

**Implementation:**
- New collection: `webhooks` (url, events[], secret, active)

  "data": {
    "view_slug": "recruiter",
    "referrer": "linkedin.com"
  }
}
```

### 19.2 Public API

---

## Phase 20: Social Proof & Networking (🟡 In Progress)
**Purpose:** Build credibility through endorsements and easy application

### 20.1 Testimonials System (✅ Complete)
**Priority:** High | **Effort:** High

Collect and display social proof from clients, colleagues, and collaborators.

**How it works:**
1. Owner generates request link with optional custom message
2. Link goes to public form: name, title, company, relationship, testimonial
3. Submission stored as "pending" for owner review
4. Owner approves/rejects in admin dashboard
5. Approved testimonials appear on designated views
6. Optional email verification for added credibility
7. Admin notification email sent when new testimonials are submitted (SMTP required)

**Implementation:**

**Backend:**
- Collections: `testimonials`, `testimonial_requests`, `email_verification_tokens`
- Service: `services/testimonial.go` - Token generation, HMAC validation
- Service: `services/email.go` - Admin notification & verification email templates
- Service: `services/email_i18n.go` - Email translations (en, de, elvish, klingon, lolcat)
- Hooks: `hooks/testimonials.go` - 14 API endpoints (700+ lines)
- Hooks: `hooks/smtp.go` - SMTP settings API (GET/PUT/test)
- Migrations: Schema creation + access rules

**API Endpoints:**
| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/testimonials/requests` | Yes | Create request link |
| GET | `/api/testimonials/requests` | Yes | List request links |
| DELETE | `/api/testimonials/requests/{id}` | Yes | Delete request link |
| GET | `/api/testimonials/request/{token}` | No | Validate token (public) |
| POST | `/api/testimonials/submit` | No | Submit testimonial (public) |
| GET | `/api/testimonials` | Yes | List testimonials |
| POST | `/api/testimonials/{id}/approve` | Yes | Approve testimonial |
| POST | `/api/testimonials/{id}/reject` | Yes | Reject testimonial |
| PATCH | `/api/testimonials/{id}` | Yes | Update testimonial |
| DELETE | `/api/testimonials/{id}` | Yes | Delete testimonial |
| GET | `/api/testimonials/pending-count` | Yes | Get pending count |
| GET | `/api/public/testimonials` | No | Public approved list |
| POST | `/api/testimonials/verify/email` | No | Send verification |
| GET | `/api/testimonials/verify/email/{token}` | No | Complete verification |

**Frontend:**
- `/testimonial/[token]` - Public submission form
- `/testimonial/verify/[token]` - Email verification page
- `/admin/testimonials` - Manage testimonials (approve, reject, feature)
- `/admin/testimonials/requests` - Manage request links
- `TestimonialsSection.svelte` - Public display (wall, carousel, featured layouts)
- Collapsible "Testimonials" section in admin sidebar with pending count badge

**Security:**
- HMAC-SHA256 hashed tokens (raw tokens never stored)
- Rate limiting on public submission endpoints
- Email verification tokens expire after 15 minutes
- Request links support expiration dates and max uses
- No account required for testimonial submitters
- Admin notifications sent via SafeGo (goroutine with panic recovery)
- Verification emails use resolveBaseURL() for correct link generation behind reverse proxies

### 20.2 "Apply with Facet" Button
**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** Very High

Enable one-click job applications using Facet profile.

**The Challenge:**
This requires the *receiving* side (employers) to integrate. Two approaches:

**Approach A: Embeddable Widget (Simpler)**
```html
<!-- Employer adds to job posting -->
<a href="https://facet.example.com/apply?job=senior-dev&company=acme"
   class="facet-apply-btn">
  Apply with Facet
</a>
```

When clicked:
1. Applicant lands on their Facet instance
2. Selects which view to share
3. Facet generates a time-limited share link
4. Emails the link to the employer (address in URL params)

**Approach B: Facet Network (Complex)**
- Central directory of Facet instances
- Employers register to receive applications
- OAuth handshake between instances
- This is essentially building a job board

**Recommended: Start with Approach A**
- Zero employer integration required
- Works immediately
- Can evolve into Approach B later

**Implementation (Approach A):**
- `/apply` route that shows view selector
- Email template for application
- Include: view link, optional cover note, contact info
- Track sent applications in new `applications` collection
